# GNUPG

Linux will pinentry-gnome, macos will use pinentry-mac as interface client.

## GPG forwarding

1. Generate ssh config with gpg forwarding enabled using the following command. This will append a
   config to your `~/.ssh/config`.

   ```sh
   generate-ssh-gpg-config kuro 10.0.0.3 ztlevi
   ```

2. You can either add `StreamLocalBindUnlink yes` to your `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and restart your
   sshd service. Or use `ssh-with-gpg-socket-deleted kuro 10.0.0.3 ztlevi` to kill remote gpg-agent
   and then create a ssh session with local gpg forwarded.
3. Copy the puclic key to the remote machine

   ```sh
   scp $HOME/.gnupg/pubring.kbx kuro:/home/ztlevi/.gnupg
   ```

   If you already exported it, you can do

   ```sh
   gpg --import mypublickey.pub
   ```
